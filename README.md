# sleepy-snorem-diagnostics
A basic bash diagnostics script for Debian based systems

This script is just for fun, please do not take it too seriously.

You can save [this script to a file named `snorem_diags.sh`](snorem_diags.sh), and then make it executable with the command `chmod +x snorem_diags.sh`. Once the script is executable, you can run it by typing `./snorem_diags.sh` in a terminal window.
