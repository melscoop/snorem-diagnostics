# sleepy-snorem-diagnostics
A basic bash diagnostics script for Debian based systems

You can save this script to a file named `system_diagnostics.sh`, and then make it executable with the command `chmod +x system_diagnostics.sh`. Once the script is executable, you can run it by typing `./system_diagnostics.sh` in a terminal window.
